My name is Zoey(Zou) Yang, and I am a graduate student in Data Science at Boston University. My research interests focus on developing machine learning and causal inference techniques to understand human behavior, improve decision-making, and address algorithmic bias, with a special interest in health-related societal challenges. Before moving to Boston, I spent two years working as a Data Scientist and Data Analyst at a tech company and AI startups. I hold an MS from Cornell University and a BA from Rutgers University.

At BU, I am fortunate to be part of <a href="https://truthmarket.com/">Platform Governance Research Lab</a>, advised by <a href="https://truthmarket.com/people/mva/index.html">Professor Van Alstyne</a>. I am also privileged to collaborate with <a href="https://www.aeghassami.com/">Professor Ghassami</a> from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and <a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/directory/julia-r-koehler">Professor Köhler</a> from Boston Children's Hospital to address community health issues using Causal Inference.
